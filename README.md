# X-RayGPT: A Biomedical RAG Chatbot for Radiology Report Generation and Severity Prediction

**X-RayGPT** is a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines radiology reports and chest X-ray images to generate clinical summaries, predict severity levels, and assist in diagnostic reasoning.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project uses:
- **LLMs (BioGPT)** for medical language generation
- **DenseNet-121** for extracting visual features from X-rays
- **BioBERT** for encoding radiology reports
- **FAISS** for fast similarity search over multimodal embeddings
- **Gradio UI** for an interactive chatbot experience

Users can input a **clinical query** with or without an uploaded **chest X-ray image**, and the system returns a **diagnostic summary** based on similar historical cases.
